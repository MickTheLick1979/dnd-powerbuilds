# Barrow Guard (Fighter Subclass – One D&D 2024)

## Subclass Overview
Barrow Guards are stoic warriors bound to the power of the grave, channeling spectral energies and necromantic might. Some have returned from death by divine or arcane means, while others guard sacred tombs, standing as eternal wardens to ensure the dead remain undisturbed. These fighters wield ghostly steeds, spectral hands, and the strength of departed souls to defend the boundaries between life and death.

## Subclass Features by Level

### Level 3
- **Death Knight:**  
  You harbor the remnants of departed souls, represented by Draugr Dice that fuel your subclass powers.  
  - **Draugr Dice:**  
    - **Fighter Level 3:** 4d6  
    - **Fighter Level 5:** 6d8  
    - **Fighter Level 9:** 8d8  
    - **Fighter Level 11:** 8d10  
    - **Fighter Level 13:** 10d10  
    - **Fighter Level 17:** 12d12  
  - You regain one Draugr Die when you finish a Short Rest, and all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.  
  - **Save DC for Draugr Powers:** 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Constitution modifier.  
  - You cannot use powers requiring Draugr Dice if all your dice are expended.

  **Features of Death Knight:**  
  - **Dark Rider:** As a Bonus Action, manifest a ghostly undead steed (Warhorse stat block, creature type Undead, resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing). It can only Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.  
    - When it Dashes, expend and roll a Draugr Die to increase its speed by 5 × the number rolled.  
    - The steed lasts 1 hour, until reduced to 0 HP, you become Incapacitated, or you die.  
    - You may use this once per Short or Long Rest, or expend a Draugr Die (no action) to regain its use.
  - **Grave Guard:** When you take damage, use a Reaction to expend and roll a Draugr Die, reducing damage taken by the result + your Constitution modifier.
  - **Soul Reaper:** When taking the Attack action, you may forgo one attack to summon ghostly hands around a creature within 60 feet. Expend and roll a Draugr Die.  
    - Target must make a Strength saving throw. On failure:  
      - Takes Necrotic damage equal to the roll + Constitution modifier.  
      - Gains the Grappled condition (escape DC = your Draugr power DC) for 1 minute.  
    - On success: Takes half damage and is not Grappled.

### Level 7
- **Siphoning Souls:**  
  Harness the essence of dying creatures for power.  
  - **Mortal Coil:** When a non-Construct, non-Undead enemy within 30 feet dies, use a Reaction to regain one Draugr Die.  
  - **Whisper of the Departed:** When making an ability check, you may expend and roll a Draugr Die, adding the result to your roll.

### Level 10
- **Tomb Castellan:**  
  Your Death Knight powers strengthen:  
  - **Phantom Charger:** Your Dark Rider steed ignores Difficult Terrain.  
    - When it Dashes, Disengages, or Dodges, expend and roll a Draugr Die. The steed teleports (with you, if riding) to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet.  
    - Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the steed when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Necrotic damage equal to the roll + Constitution modifier on a failed save (half on success).
  - **Death Knell:** When you use Grave Guard to reduce damage, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to half the amount of damage reduced.  
  - **Spectral Shrieking:** At the start of a creature’s turn Grappled by Soul Reaper, it takes Psychic damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You may expend and roll a Draugr Die as a Reaction, adding the result to the damage.

### Level 15
- **Grave Lord:**  
  You command the dead’s essence with absolute mastery.  
  - **On a Pale Horse:** Your Dark Rider steed can carry one additional creature.  
    - When expending a Draugr Die during its Dash, it can move through solid objects and creatures as Difficult Terrain (riders included).  
    - If it ends its turn inside a solid object, it and riders take 1d10 Force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.
  - **Sepulchral Shield:** When using Grave Guard, choose the triggering damage type; you gain resistance to that type (including the triggering damage) until the start of your next turn.  
  - **Death Grip:** A creature Grappled by Soul Reaper is also Restrained until the grapple ends.

### Level 18
- **Might of the Necropolis:**  
  Your body and soul transcend mortal limits.  
  - **Eternal Vigil:** You no longer age, cannot be magically aged, do not die of old age, and no longer require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
  - **Restless Dead:** When rolling Initiative, if you have fewer than 3 Draugr Dice, you regain expended dice until you have 3.
