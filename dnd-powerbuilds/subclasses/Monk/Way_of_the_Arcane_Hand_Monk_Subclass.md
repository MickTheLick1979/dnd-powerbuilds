# Way of the Arcane Hand (Monk Subclass – One D&D 2024)

## Subclass Overview
Monks who follow the Way of the Arcane Hand channel the weave of arcane magic through disciplined martial practices. Though not inherently born to magic, these monks have mastered tapping into cosmic energies to enhance their strikes, cast spells, and augment their battlefield presence.

## Subclass Features by Level

### Level 3
- **Erudite Education:**  
  You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. When making an Intelligence ability check, add a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

- **Spellcasting:**  
  You gain the ability to cast Wizard spells using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability.  
  - **Arcane Focus:** You may use a monk weapon as a spellcasting focus.  
  - **Cantrips:** Learn two Wizard cantrips of your choice. You learn a third at 10th level.  
  - **Spell Slots:** You have spell slots as shown on the Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table (not included here). You regain all expended spell slots after a Long Rest.  
  - **Spells Known:** Begin with three 1st-level Wizard spells of your choice. You gain more as indicated by the Spellcasting table and may swap spells upon gaining a level.  
  - **Spellcasting Ability:**  
    - **Save DC:** 8 + proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier.  
    - **Attack Modifier:** Proficiency bonus + Wisdom modifier.

- **Eldritch Flurry:**  
  - When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with the casting of a cantrip (as part of the Attack action).  
  - When using Flurry of Blows, you may take the Magic action to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a Bonus Action, replacing your unarmed strikes. You can still only cast one leveled spell per turn.  
  - When casting a spell using the Magic action, treat the spell as if it were an attack with a monk weapon for triggering features like Martial Arts or subclass abilities.

### Level 6
- **Arcane Empowerment:**  
  While concentrating on a spell, you add bonus damage equal to twice the spell’s level to all unarmed strikes and attacks made with monk weapons.

### Level 11
- **Focus Power:**  
  When casting a spell using the Magic action, you may expend Focus Points to increase the spell’s level beyond the slot used:  
  - Spend 1 Focus Point for each additional spell level.  
  - You may increase the level beyond your highest spell slot, up to a maximum level equal to your proficiency bonus.  
  - Example: At 11th level (proficiency bonus +4), casting *Scorching Ray* using a 2nd-level slot, you could spend 2 Focus Points to cast it as a 4th-level spell.

- **Spell Resistance:**  
  You gain advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. You also gain resistance to all damage from spells and magical effects.

### Level 17
- **Meditative Casting:**  
  When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action that normally requires concentration, you may expend Focus Points equal to the spell’s level. If you do, the spell does not require concentration and instead lasts for up to 1 minute (or its normal duration, whichever is shorter).
