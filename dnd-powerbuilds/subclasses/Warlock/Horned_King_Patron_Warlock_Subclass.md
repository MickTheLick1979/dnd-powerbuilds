# Horned King Patron (Warlock Subclass – One D&D 2024)

## Subclass Overview
Warlocks who pledge themselves to the Horned King sign a pact steeped in corruption and blood. These warlocks channel witchcraft, rot, and maledictions granted by their antlered patron, weaving rituals and curses to torment their foes. As they spread the Horned King’s will, their own forms and powers begin to mirror their patron’s dark majesty.

## Subclass Features by Level

### Level 3
- **Horned King Spells:**  
  You always have the following spells prepared, and they do not count against your number of spells prepared:  
  - **3rd Level:** *Animal Friendship, Bane, Spike Growth, Suggestion*  
  - **5th Level:** *Bestow Curse, Fly*  
  - **7th Level:** *Phantasmal Killer, Polymorph*  
  - **9th Level:** *Dominate Person, Scrying*

- **Witch Mark:**  
  After a Long Rest, you can imbue a nonmagical Tiny object you hold with a Warlock spell you have prepared that has a casting time of 1 action. A creature holding the object can use the Magic action to cast the spell using your Charisma, spell attack, and save DC. The mark fades once cast or when you finish a Long Rest.

- **Malediction:**  
  As a Magic action, curse a creature you can see within 60 feet until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, when a creature within 60 feet targets you with an attack or spell, you can use a Reaction to curse it. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), regaining all uses after a Long Rest.  
  Choose one curse when invoking this feature:  
  - **Agony:** Target has Disadvantage on its next attack roll or Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration (your choice).  
  - **Hate:** Target has Disadvantage on its next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (your choice).  
  - **Rot:** The next time the target takes damage, it takes an additional 1d10 Necrotic damage and cannot regain Hit Points until the end of its next turn.

### Level 6
- **Spiteful Curse:**  
  When you use Malediction, you may cast *Bestow Curse* once without expending a spell slot as part of the action or Reaction. You regain this ability after a Long Rest.  
  - If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the use of this feature is not expended.  
  - When cast this way, the spell has a range of 60 feet, lasts 1 minute, and does not require Concentration.  
  - If the spell fails, you may instead inflict one Malediction curse on the target.

### Level 10
- **Crown of Horns:**  
  As a Bonus Action, manifest a visible mark of the Horned King’s power (such as a crown of horns or great antlers) for 1 minute.  
  - You can use this feature once per Long Rest, or restore a use by expending a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required).  
  - While active:  
    - **Dark Heart:** Once on each of your turns, when you damage a creature, it takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.  
    - **King of All:** You emanate a 20-foot aura. When you activate this feature and at the start of each of your turns, choose one creature you can see in the aura. It must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer one of the following effects (your choice) until the start of your next turn:  
      - **Enticement:** Target is Charmed.  
      - **Wickedness:** Target has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.  
      - **Terror:** Target is Frightened and must move away from you by the safest route unless it cannot.

### Level 14
- **Gather the Coven:**  
  You may perform a 1-hour ritual (during a rest) to bond with up to six willing creatures within 10 feet of you. The bond ends if you die or you end it (no action required). While bonded:  
  - **Witchcraft:** Choose one Malediction curse. Each bonded creature can use that Reaction option once per Long Rest.  
  - **Fly By Night:** As a Bonus Action, teleport to the nearest unoccupied space next to a bonded creature on the same plane. You may use this once per Short or Long Rest. If your Crown of Horns is active, this use is not expended.  
  - **Hand of the King:** While your Crown of Horns is active, the first time each bonded creature damages another creature on its turn, that target takes an extra 1d10 Necrotic damage.
