# Bladesinger (One D&D UA Subclass)

## Level 3: Bladesong
As a Bonus Action, you invoke an elven magic called the **Bladesong**, provided you aren’t wearing armour or using a Shield.

The Bladesong lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you don armour or a Shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While the Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits. You can invoke the Bladesong a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

- **Agility:** You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1), and your Speed increases by 10 feet.
- **Bladework:** When you attack with a weapon with which you have proficiency, you can use your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls instead of Strength or Dexterity.
- **Focus:** When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the total.

## Level 3: Training in War and Song
You gain proficiency with all Melee Martial weapons that don’t have the Two-Handed or Heavy property. You can use a Melee weapon with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: **Acrobatics, Athletics, Performance, or Persuasion**.

## Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

## Level 10: Song of Defense
When you take damage while your Bladesong is active, you can take a Reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to five times the spell slot’s level.

## Level 14: Song of Victory
After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.
